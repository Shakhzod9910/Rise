            <p>Rise was the brainchild of Rob Oyston who developed the idea for the movement-based programme following a stay in hospital. Originally operating under the Mobi-Game brand, Rob successfully launched his programme in the care home sector where the vibrancy of classes and inclusivity of the activities won over the hearts and minds of residents and care home owners alike. Enter business, franchising and care sector experts Trevor and Sam Brocklebank, and Rise was born. The programme is ideally suited to franchising with standards set centrally but delivered at a local level by franchisees. 
            Rob, Trevor and Sam are joined by a fantastic management team who share their passion.</p>

Originally operating under the Mobi-Game name, Rob’s programme brings real benefits to participants whilst impressing the regulatory authorities looking for positive outcomes in care settings.</p>
